You are given a chronological list of gameplay summaries (from oldest to newest).

The LAST summary is the most recent one. It contains the current game state, current objectives, and next steps. It is your PRIMARY document — you will enhance it, not replace it.

Your task:
- Take the LAST summary as your base.
- Enrich it by pulling in any important HISTORICAL facts, events, or timeline details from the PREVIOUS summaries that are missing or incomplete in the last one.
- The goal is to make the last summary more complete about PAST events, while keeping its current state, current objectives, and next steps EXACTLY as they are.

Rules:
- DO NOT change the "current state", "next steps", or "Navigation Continuity" sections of the last summary. Those reflect the latest game state and spatial reasoning and must be preserved as-is.
- DO NOT replace next steps / objectives with outdated ones from older summaries.
- DO enrich the historical timeline: add any past events, milestones, step numbers, or details that the last summary is missing but that appear in earlier summaries.
- PRESERVE all "Navigation Continuity" details (current destination, route, failed attempts, spatial lessons) from the latest summary — this prevents the AI from repeating navigation mistakes after rollup.
- Treat earlier summaries as canonical for historical facts. If there is a conflict about a PAST event, prefer the earlier summary.
- Do NOT invent facts. If something is not present in any summary, mark it UNKNOWN or omit it.
- Do NOT contradict confirmed facts.
- Preserve the summary format exactly: your output must start with <summary> and end with </summary>.
- Do not include any other text outside the <summary>...</summary> block.

CRITICAL: This enhanced summary will be the ONLY summary kept going forward — all previous summaries will be discarded. Any historical detail you fail to include will be permanently lost. Be thorough!
