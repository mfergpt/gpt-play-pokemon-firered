The conversation has been too long; it is time to summarize recent gameplay so we can continue without losing context.

Your task is to create a concise, continuation-ready INCREMENTAL summary.
This summary covers ONLY what happened since the last summary. The previous summary (in <previous_summary> tags) already has all prior context — do NOT rewrite or repeat it.

---

## DATA INTEGRITY RULES

1) **Current state must come from the latest RAM snapshot**
- The latest `<extracted_ram_data>` is the **authoritative source** for: location, party, HP, moves, inventory, money, badges.
- If not present, mark fields as **UNKNOWN**. Do not guess.

2) **Incremental only**
- The previous summary is your base. Only ADD new information.
- Do not rewrite sections that haven't changed (team stats, old maze solutions, old defeats).
- Only correct prior info if you have direct evidence — add a CORRECTION note.

3) **No hallucinations**
- Only include information explicitly supported by conversation/logs/RAM.
- Use confidence tags: **[CONFIRMED]** (in RAM/log), **[INFERRED]** (implied), **[UNKNOWN]** (not available).

## SUMMARY OUTPUT FORMAT

Your response must start with `<summary>` and end with `</summary>`.
Keep the TOTAL summary under 6000 characters. Be concise.

<summary>
# GAMEPLAY SUMMARY

## Overview
2-3 sentences: what happened since the last summary. Key milestones, battles, catches, routing changes.

## Current Game State (RAM-Authoritative)
- Location (map + coords + facing)
- Badges obtained (count/8)
- Money
- Current objective

## Pokémon Team
For each party member: Nickname (Species) Lv## — HP current/max — Moves (PP if low)
Only note changes since last summary (new moves, evolutions, level ups). Don't rewrite unchanged team members.

## Inventory (Key Items Only)
Balls, heals, status cures, key items. Only what matters for next steps.

## Navigation Continuity (CRITICAL)
This section prevents getting lost after the summary wipe:
- **Current destination:** Where were we heading and why?
- **Route:** The specific path/waypoints being followed
- **Last 3-5 failed movements:** What tiles/directions failed and why
- **Spatial lessons this session:** New wall gaps, NPC positions, warp behaviors, tile traps discovered
- **Immediate next action:** The exact next move when gameplay resumes

## Map Exploration Status
- Current area: notable unexplored zones near the objective
- Missing/uncertain connections (doors/stairs/ladders/warps)
- Only what's relevant to the current objective — not a full map dump

## Dungeon / Maze Solutions (Only New or Updated)
Only include NEW maze/dungeon info discovered since last summary.
- Key connections (ladder → floor, warp → destination)
- Successful routes found
- Pitfalls/one-way patterns
If no new dungeon progress, skip this section entirely.

## Battles & Defeats (Since Last Summary Only)
- Notable battles (gym leaders, rival, rockets, tough wilds)
- Any defeats/restarts: what happened, what changed afterward
- Only events since the last summary. Max 3-5 entries.

## Boss Prep (If Relevant)
Only if approaching a gym/boss: what we know, what worked/failed, planned strategy.
Skip if not relevant right now.

## Recent Timeline (Since Last Summary)
Bullet points of key events since the last summary: battles, catches, menu decisions, dialogue hints, routing pivots.
Keep it concise — focus on what matters for continuing gameplay.

## Critical Decisions & Strategy Notes
Any high-impact choices made since last summary: TM usage, role assignments, XP routing, inventory management, boss prep adjustments.
Skip if nothing notable.

## Bag Kits Readiness
- Catch readiness (balls + status tools)
- Dungeon readiness (heals + status cures + escape rope)
- Boss readiness (strong heals + status cures)
State what's missing if not ready.

## PC Storage (If Changed)
Pokémon or items stored in PC that matter (HM mules, backups, role candidates).
Skip if unchanged since last summary.

## Memory / Markers Updates
List memory entries and markers to add/update/remove based on confirmed evidence this session.
Skip if nothing changed.

## Goals & Next Steps
- Primary objective with WHY/HOW
- 2-3 secondary objectives
- Immediate prep needs (heals, levels, items)
</summary>

## CRITICAL REMINDERS
- **INCREMENTAL ONLY.** Do not rewrite the full journey timeline. The previous summary has it.
- **Under 6000 characters.** If you're over, cut detail from battles and inventory first.
- **Navigation is king.** The #1 cause of post-summary problems is spatial confusion. Prioritize navigation continuity.
- **Do not use the 'execute_action' tool.** Your sole task is to write the summary text.
