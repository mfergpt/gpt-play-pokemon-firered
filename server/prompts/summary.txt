Summarize ONLY the new events since the last summary. Be BRIEF. Do NOT rewrite old history.

Your response must start with `<summary>` and end with `</summary>`.

## RULES
- Current game state (team, location, items, money, badges) MUST come from the latest RAM data. Do not guess.
- Only cover events that happened SINCE the last summary.
- Keep the entire summary under 3000 words. Shorter is better.
- Tag key facts: [CONFIRMED] = from RAM/logs, [INFERRED] = implied, [UNKNOWN] = not visible.
