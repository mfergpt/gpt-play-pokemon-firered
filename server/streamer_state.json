I'm still at the title screen and need to advance through the menu to load my save.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe first START press opened the title screen menu dialog. I need to use a_until_end_of_dialog to continue through any additional prompts and reach the main menu (Continue/New Game/Options). From there I can load my saved game.\n\n**Context:**\nThis is standard title screen navigation. After pressing START, there may be additional copyright/warning screens before the main menu appears. Using a_until_end_of_dialog will efficiently advance through all of them until I reach the Continue option.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Use a_until_end_of_dialog to advance through title screen dialogs\n2. Once main menu appears, select \"Continue\" to load save\n3. Resume gameplay in Oak's Lab and exit toward Route 1\n\n**Observations:**\nStill showing title screen dialog. Need to advance to main menu to load save file.",
