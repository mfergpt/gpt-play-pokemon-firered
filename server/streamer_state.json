  "step_details": "Pathfinding confirmed the marked clerk at (2,3) is unreachable from our current accessible area inside Viridian Mart, so that marker is likely for the parcel cutscene clerk and not the actual shop interface (or the shop counter layout changed). Next best move: test other nearby NPCs in the reachable area to find the real cashier/shop trigger. We’ll step to (6,4) and talk to the NPC at (6,3) (labeled YOUNGSTER) to see if it opens the Buy/Sell menu; if not, we’ll try the woman next.",
