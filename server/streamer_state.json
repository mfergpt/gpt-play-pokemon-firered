  "step_details": "**STUCK IN VIRIDIAN CITY - FINDING ROUTE TO (25,39)**\n\nI'm at (26,22) in Viridian City after moving LEFT 10 tiles then DOWN from the Mart area. Hit a collision wall at (26,22) trying to move DOWN/RIGHT - the explored map shows walls (⛔) at rows y=23-28 blocking southward movement from column x=26.\n\nLooking at the explored map from my current position (26,22):\n- **Target:** Route 1 south entrance at (25,39) marked with ⬇️\n- **Current:** (26,22) facing DOWN\n- **Pokémon Center** is right here at (26,26) - I can see it 4 tiles below me!\n\nThe walls blocking me are the Pokémon Center building (⛔ from y=23-28 at columns x=24-28).\n\n**ALTERNATE ROUTE:**\nLooking at the explored map, I can see row y=22 from x=7 to x=41 is mostly 🟫 free ground (except walls at x=0-6 and x=42-43). Column x=25 from y=31 onwards goes south to (25,39).\n\nFrom (26,22), the route is:\n1. LEFT 1 tile: (26,22) → (25,22)\n2. DOWN many tiles: (25,22) → (25,31) [pass through free ground]\n3. Continue DOWN: (25,31) → (25,39) [Route 1 entrance!]\n\nLooking at column x=25 from y=22 to y=39:\n- y=22: 🟫\n- y=23-24: ⛔ (walls - Pokémon Center)\n- y=25: ⛔ (wall)\n- y=26: ✨ (sign tile)\n- y=27-31: 🟫\n- y=39: 🟫⬇️ Route 1\n\nWait, (25,23-26) are walls. I need to go further LEFT OR RIGHT to avoid the center.\n\n**CORRECTED ROUTE:**\nFrom (26,22): go LEFT to x=23, then DOWN past the center, then RIGHT to x=25, then DOWN to (25,39).",
