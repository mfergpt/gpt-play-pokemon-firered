  "step_details": "\n## SITUATION\n- **Location:** ROUTE2_VIRIDIAN_FOREST_NORTH_ENTRANCE (15-3) at (7,2) elevation 3, facing DOWN\n- **Map transition:** Successfully warped from Route 2 (5,14) → Gate building interior (7,2)\n- **Party status:** All Pokemon fully healed - DEGEN 32/32 HP, TI 14/14 HP, BASED 15/15 HP, MOON 18/18 HP\n- **Current map:** 15x12 tiles gate building interior with NPCs and multiple doors\n- **Objective:** Navigate through the gate building to the south exit, then continue to Viridian Forest\n\n## CRITICAL MARKER FIX NEEDED\nLooking at the explored_map and the action logs:\n- I entered from Route 2 (5,14) and arrived at (7,2) in the gate building\n- The marker at Route 2 (5,13) was placed INCORRECTLY - it should have been on (5,14) the actual door tile\n- Looking at \"Doors / Ladders Without Custom Markers\" section: �� Door at (7,1) is unmarked\n- This door at (7,1) is the NORTH EXIT back to Route 2 (3-20)\n\nAccording to the entrance/exit protocol, I need to:\n1. Add a marker at the north door (7,1) in this building for the Route 2 connection\n2. Fix the incorrect marker at Route 2 (5,13) by deleting it and placing it on (5,14)\n\nHowever, I should focus on the PRIMARY OBJECTIVE first: reaching Viridian Forest. I'll fix markers as I go, but not delay the mission unnecessarily.\n\n## CURRENT BUILDING LAYOUT ANALYSIS\nFrom the explored_map:\n- North exit at (7,1) leads back to Route 2 north section\n- South exit marker at (7,11) (⬇️) leads to Viridian Forest (1-0) at (4,10)\n- Two NPCs visible: YOUNGSTER at (5,4) and COOLTRAINER_F at (10,5)\n- Free path from (7,2) → (7,11) requires moving DOWN 9 tiles\n\nRoute: (7,2) → DOWN 9 tiles → (7,11) south exit marker\nThen step DOWN one more time to trigger the warp to Viridian Forest.\n\n## REASONING\nI'll navigate directly to the south exit at (7,11) by moving DOWN 9 tiles in one sequence. This is a straightforward path with no obstacles based on the explored_map showing all �� free ground tiles between (7,2) and (7,11).\n\nAfter reaching (7,11), I'll step DOWN once more to trigger the warp to Viridian Forest at (4,10).\n\n## CONTEXT\nThis is a simple transit building connecting Route 2 north (Pewter City side) and Viridian Forest (south side). I've been through here before during my initial journey to Pewter City, so the route is already mapped with markers.\n\nOnce I reach Viridian Forest, I'll begin the grinding session: battling 4-6 wild Bug Pokemon to gain ~116-136 XP needed for DEGEN to level from Lv12 → Lv13 and relearn Metal Claw.\n\n## PLAN\n1. Send 9× DOWN from (7,2) → (7,11) to reach the south exit marker\n2. Next turn: Step DOWN once more to trigger warp to Viridian Forest (1-0) at (4,10)\n3. Begin grinding wild battles until DEGEN hits Lv13 and learns Metal Claw\n4. Return to Pewter City and challenge Brock's Gym\n\n## OBSERVATIONS\n- Gate building is well-mapped from previous exploration\n- South exit marker at (7,11) is correctly placed on the red carpet tile\n- The building has NPCs I can talk to if needed, but not necessary for current mission\n- All PP and HP are fully restored, ready for grinding\n",
