  "step_details": "We’re inside Viridian City Mart at (4,7). The CLERK at (2,3) appears to be in an unreachable pocket behind walls/counters, so it’s likely not the active cashier. We need to find who actually opens the shop menu so we can buy Poké Balls/Potions. Next we’ll approach the reachable NPC at (7,2) (labeled YOUNGSTER) by standing at (7,3) and talking upward with a_until_end_of_dialog; if he doesn’t open Buy/Sell, we’ll try the woman at (9,5) next.",
