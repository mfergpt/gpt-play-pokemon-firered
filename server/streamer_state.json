  "step_details": "\n## SITUATION\n- **Location:** VIRIDIAN_FOREST (1-0) at (5,10) elevation 3, facing DOWN\n- **Map transition:** Successfully warped from gate building (7,10) → Viridian Forest (5,10)\n- **Party status:** ALL POKEMON FULLY HEALED - DEGEN 32/32 HP, TI 14/14 HP, BASED 15/15 HP, MOON 18/18 HP\n- **Map update:** Important collision changes detected - tiles that were collision (⛔) became free (��) and vice versa at (5,22), (44,29), (45,45), (7,22), (47,29), (47,45)\n- **Current objective:** Grind DEGEN from Lv12 → Lv13 to relearn Metal Claw\n\n## CRITICAL REALIZATION\nWait - the action log shows \"Free Ground/Collision tiles changed on map 1-0\". Let me analyze this:\n\n**Collision to Free:**\n- (5,22) - was ⛔, now ��\n- (44,29) - was ⛔, now ��\n- (45,45) - was ⛔, now ��\n\n**Free to Collision:**\n- (7,22) - was ��, now ⛔\n- (47,29) - was ��, now ⛔\n- (47,45) - was ��, now ⛔\n\nLooking at my markers:\n- (7,22) has �� BUG CATCHER SAMMY (DEFEATED!)\n- (47,29) has �� BUG CATCHER DOUG (DEFEATED!)\n- (47,45) has �� BUG CATCHER RICK (DEFEATED!)\n\nThese are ALL DEFEATED TRAINERS! When I defeated them earlier, they became collision tiles (⛔) because they're standing there. Now the tiles where they were standing became ⛔ (collision/impassable), which makes sense - the NPCs are blocking those tiles.\n\nThe tiles at (5,22), (44,29), (45,45) that became FREE (��) are likely tiles that were previously blocked by temporary obstacles or NPCs that have moved.\n\nThis is a NORMAL game mechanic - defeated trainers become static obstacles. This doesn't affect my grinding plan.\n\n## GRINDING STRATEGY\nI'm at (5,10) in Viridian Forest. Looking at the explored_map, this is near the NORTH EXIT area. I need to grind wild Pokemon to gain ~116-136 XP for DEGEN to level from Lv12 → Lv13.\n\nWild Pokemon grinding strategy:\n- Move into TALL GRASS (�� tiles) to trigger random encounters\n- Use EMBER (25/25PP available) to OHKO Bug Pokemon (Caterpie, Weedle, Kakuna, Metapod)\n- Each battle gives ~25-35 XP\n- Need 4-6 battles total\n\nLooking at nearby grass tiles:\n- (11,5) - (50,5) is a long corridor of grass\n- (11,6) - (50,6) is grass\n- Area around (11-23, 5-15) has lots of grass tiles\n\nThe fastest way to trigger encounters is to move back and forth in grass using long directional sequences. I'll use the pattern: `['up', 'down', 'left', 'right'] * 10` to move randomly in grass until a battle triggers.\n\nActually, looking at my current position (5,10) and the visible_area:\n- (6,10) = �� free ground\n- (5,11) = �� free ground\n- (11,10) = �� grass\n- (12,10) = �� grass\n\nI should move RIGHT toward the grass tiles at x=11+ to start encountering wild Pokemon.\n\nFrom (5,10) to (11,10) grass area:\n- RIGHT 6 tiles from x=5 → x=11\n\nThen I'll start moving randomly in the grass to trigger encounters.\n\n## REASONING\nI'll navigate to the nearest grass area at (11,10) and then start moving randomly to trigger wild encounters. The grass corridor at y=5-15, x=11-23 is a perfect grinding spot - it's well-explored, no trainer NPCs nearby, and full of grass tiles.\n\n## CONTEXT\nAfter DEGEN hits Lv13 and learns Metal Claw, I'll immediately return to Pewter City via the north exit at (4,9), heal if needed, then challenge Brock's Gym with the Steel-type advantage against his Rock/Ground team.\n\n## PLAN\n1. Move RIGHT 6 tiles from (5,10) → (11,10) to reach grass area\n2. Start random movement pattern in grass to trigger wild encounters\n3. Battle wild Pokemon using EMBER until DEGEN levels up to Lv13\n4. Return to Pewter City and challenge Brock\n\n## OBSERVATIONS\n- Party is fully healed and ready for grinding\n- Ember has full 25/25PP - enough for 12+ OHKO battles before needing heal\n- Money: 540P available if I need to buy items (but shouldn't need any for grinding)\n- All defeated trainers in this area are now collision tiles (can't battle them again)\n",
